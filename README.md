## What is CodePlayer?

> Codeplayer is a basic website which lets you write HTML5,CSS3 and JS commands on their separate sections within the page and then shows you the output on the 4th section. This idea is the base into making any web dev IDE for code compilation and execution. HTML5,CSS3,JS,jQuery are the skills used in this project.
